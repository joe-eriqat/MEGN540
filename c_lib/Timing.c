 *  FCPU = 16 000 000 Hz,  1 us => 1 000 000 Hz,  A prescalar of 16 would give you millisecond resolution, but you dont
 *  have enough time to do those additions every microsecond, in addition the 8-bit timer will roll over every 256 microseconds.
 *  So, you need to be counting in (effectively) 4us increments.  So use a prescalar of 64. This will give you a resolution of 4us per
 *  Timer0 Bit and enough head-room to compare at with 249 for a 1kHz update.
 *
 *  Since Timer 0 will be triggering at a kHz, we may want other things to be updated at 1kHz too.
